#FairRoot 

##The framework 
A simulation, reconstruction and analysis framework that is based on the ROOT system. 
The user can create simulated data and/or perform analysis with the same framework.  Geant3 and Geant4 transport engines are supported, however the user code that creates simulated data do not depend on a particular monte carlo engine. The framework delivers base classes which enable the users to  construct their detectors and /or analysis tasks in a simple way, it also delivers some general functionality like track visualization. Moreover an interface for reading magnetic field maps is also implemented.
